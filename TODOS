Group markers
 - Allow custom names
 - Show team info when clicking team marker
 - Make markers server side? At least synchronize updates

Player markers
 - Vehicle icon color. (rn it's always white, I want it to be the right team colour or side colour if no squadmates)
Ace incapacitated people don't show up (Might be cause they're CIV, fix later? (: )
